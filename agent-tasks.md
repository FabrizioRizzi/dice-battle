# 🤖 **Dice Battle** – Copilot Agent Step-by-Step Checklist

A guided checklist for building a **Dice Battle** app with Copilot Agent mode.

---

### 🎯 **Goal**
- [ ] 🎯 "Create a React app where two players virtually roll dice, and the one with the highest roll wins."

---

### 1️⃣ **Project Setup**

- [x] 💻 “Set up a new React 19 project using Vite and TailwindCSS 4.1.”
- [x] ⚙️ “Install and configure TailwindCSS in the project, ensuring it works with Vite.”

---

### 2️⃣ **App Structure**

- [x] 📂 “Create the following files in the project: `App.jsx`, `components/DiceRoller.jsx`, `components/Scoreboard.jsx`, and `styles/index.css`.”
- [x] 🧩 “Set up the basic app structure in `App.jsx` and import components like `DiceRoller` and `Scoreboard`.”

---

### 3️⃣ **Dice Roller Logic**

- [x] 🎲 “In `DiceRoller.jsx`, implement the dice roll logic using `Math.random()` to generate random numbers between 1 and 6 for both players.”
- [x] 🔁 “Create a button called ‘Roll Dice’ that triggers the dice roll and updates the dice value for each player.”

---

### 4️⃣ **Winner Determination**

- [x] 🏆 “Create a function to compare the dice values and determine which player has the higher roll. Display the winner’s name under the dice rolls.”
- [x] 💬 “Display the winner message like 'Player 1 wins!' or 'Player 2 wins!' dynamically after each roll.”

---

### 5️⃣ **Scoreboard**

- [x] 📝 “In `Scoreboard.jsx`, create a component that tracks and displays the score for each player.”
- [x] 🔢 “Update the score each time a player wins a round and display it on the scoreboard.”

---

### 6️⃣ **Arcade Style UI**

- [x] 🎨 “Design the UI to look fun and arcade-style. Use TailwindCSS for bright colors, large buttons, and dice displays.”
- [ ] 🎲 “Add dice animations when they are rolled. For example, use `framer-motion` to animate the dice bouncing or rotating.”

---

### 7️⃣ **Sound Effects**

- [ ] 🎶 “Add a sound effect when the dice are rolled and when a winner is declared.”
- [ ] 🔊 “Use the `Audio` API or a package like `howler.js` to implement sound effects.”

---

### 8️⃣ **Bonus Features**

- [ ] 🏆 “Create a Tournament Mode where players can compete in a series of rounds. Track wins, and display the winner at the end of the tournament.”
- [ ] 🏅 “Add a leaderboard to show player rankings based on the number of wins.”

---

### 9️⃣ **Testing**

- [ ] ✅ “Write basic tests to ensure the dice roll function works correctly, and the winner is displayed based on the roll results.”
- [ ] 📱 “Make sure the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.”

---

### 🔟 **Final Steps**

- [ ] 🚀 “Add deployment instructions for Vercel or Netlify to easily deploy the app online.”
- [ ] 📄 “Generate a `README.md` file with app description, features, and instructions on how to run the app locally.”

---

### 🎤 **Pitch**

- "Generate a 30-second pitch for the app that includes the key features: a fun, arcade-style dice battle game with sound effects, animations, and a tournament mode."
